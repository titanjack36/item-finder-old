# ItemFinder
ItemFinder is a website application for keeping track of miscellaneous items 
within a home. For example, the website can help you remember the location of 
your batteries, med-kit or charging cables in an organized format. Thus, if you 
ever forget where something is stored, you can use the ItemFinder's powerful 
search functionality to help you retrieve your items.
